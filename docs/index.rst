Redis Gadgets - Simple tools built on a great foundation
========================================================

Redis Gadgets collects several tools built on top of redis, for some
relatively common operations.  Set Theory automates the building and caching
of zset (ordered set) unions and intersections, and provides a few helpful
wrappers for accessing them.  Prefix Indexer provides a way to index
arbitrary values (e.g. IDs) by text string, with powerful ordering options.
Finally, Unique Count provides tools for tracking and aggregating unique
events over time.
